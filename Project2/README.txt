However, the enemy bunker is armed with a cannon, which shoots a projectile towards the helicopter. The helicopter gets hit and comes crashing down. Custom Shapes: I created two custom shapes that can be found in the dependencies.js file. The first shape is the shape I used for the front and wings for the helicopter. It is a polygon that mimics the shape of a 3D triangle. For this shape, I applied a military camouflage texture around it. My second custom shape is a pyramid that I used to create the bunker and the surrounding border ahead of the bunker. I used a steel texture for this shape.
